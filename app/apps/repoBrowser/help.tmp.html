			<h2>What's this?</h2>
			<p>Omni Explorer allows you to browse & modify the files available to php-wasm.</p>

			<p><i>Note:</i>If no directories are displayed, open up the <code>php cgi service worker</code> app and ensure the service is running, then restart Omni Explorer.</p>

			<h2>Directory Types</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><img src = "/w95/5-16-4bit.png"> This is a normal directory within the filesystem.</li>
				<li><img src = "/w95/9-16-4bit.png"> This representes a <b>mounted</b> directory.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Top level directories like <i>/tmp</i> or <i>/home</i> are regenerated each time php-wasm is re-instantiated. Since php-cgi-wasm runs in the service worker, this won't be on ever page refresh but its important to remember that these folders cannot store anything persistently.</p>

			<p><b>Mounted</b> directories that are backed by persistent IDBFS volumes are marked with a <img src = "/w95/9-16-4bit.png"> icon. These directories will contain PHP source code and configuration files, so they can be stored and  modified without fear of losing them.</p>
